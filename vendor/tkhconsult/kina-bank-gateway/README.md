> Packagist package (library) to give any php-based website an access to the interface of KinaBank that merchant systems use to process credit card based e- commerce transactions using the standard CGI/WWW forms posting method. This interface transparently supports various cardholder authentication protocols such as 3-D Secure and Secure Code as well as legacy unauthenticated SSL commerce transactions.

## Install

```sh
composer require tkhconsult/kina-bank-gateway
```

### Requirements

* PHP >= 5.5
* OpenSSL >=0.9.8 

## Usage

### Step 1. Environment configuration (not required)

You can use one of the composer packages
```bash
composer require vlucas/phpdotenv
```

or

```bash
composer require symfony/dotenv
```

.env file

```dosini
# Merchant ID assigned by bank
KINA_BANK_MERCHANT_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Merchant Terminal ID assigned by bank 
KINA_BANK_MERCHANT_TERMINAL=xxxxxxxx

# Merchant primary web site URL
KINA_BANK_MERCHANT_URL='http://example.com'

KINA_BANK_MERCHANT_NAME='Merchant company name'

# Merchant company registered office address
KINA_BANK_MERCHANT_ADDRESS='Merchant address'

# Security options - provided by the bank
KINA_BANK_SECURITY_SIGNATURE_FIRST='0001'

KINA_BANK_MERCHANT_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE=ro
```

### Step 2. Init Gateway client

#### Init Gateway client through configureFromEnv method

```php
<?php

use TkhConsult\KinaBankGateway\KinaBankGateway;

$kinaBankGateway = new KinaBankGateway();

$certDir = '/path/to/cert/dir';
$kinaBankGateway
    ->configureFromEnv($certDir)
;
```

#### Init Gateway client manually

You can reproduce implementation of the configureFromEnv() method


### Step 3. Request payment authorization - redirects to the banks page

```php
<?php

use TkhConsult\KinaBankGateway\KinaBankGateway;
$backRefUrl = getenv('KINA_BANK_MERCHANT_URL').'/after-payment/';

/** @var KinaBankGateway $kinaBankGateway */
$kinaBankGateway
    ->requestAuthorization($orderId = 1, $amount = 1, $backRefUrl, $currency = null, $description = null, $clientEmail = null, $language = null)
;
```

### Step 4. Receive bank responses - all bank responses are asynchronous server to server and are handled by same URI

```php
<?php

use TkhConsult\KinaBankGateway\KinaBankGateway;
use TkhConsult\KinaBankGateway\KinaBank\Exception;
use TkhConsult\KinaBankGateway\KinaBank\Response;
use TkhConsult\KinaBankGateway\KinaBank\AuthorizationResponse;

/** @var KinaBankGateway $kinaBankGateway */
$bankResponse = $kinaBankGateway->getResponseObject($_POST);

if (!$bankResponse->isValid()) {
    throw new Exception('Invalid bank Auth response');
}

switch ($bankResponse::TRX_TYPE) {
    case KinaBankGateway::TRX_TYPE_AUTHORIZATION:
        $amount         = $bankResponse->{Response::AMOUNT};
        $bankOrderCode  = $bankResponse->{Response::ORDER};
        $rrn            = $bankResponse->{Response::RRN};
        $intRef         = $bankResponse->{Response::INT_REF};

        #
        # You must save $rrn and $intRef from the response here for reversal requests
        #

        # Funds locked on bank side - transfer the product/service to the customer and request completion
        $kinaBankGateway->requestCompletion($amount, $bankOrderCode, $rrn, $intRef, $currency = null);
        break;

    case KinaBankGateway::TRX_TYPE_COMPLETION:
        # Funds successfully transferred on bank side
        break;

    case KinaBankGateway::TRX_TYPE_REVERSAL:
        # Reversal successfully applied on bank size
        break;

    default:
        throw new Exception('Unknown bank response transaction type');
}
```

### Step 5. Request reversal (refund)

```$rrn``` and ```$intRef``` must be saved on the step 4

```php
<?php

use TkhConsult\KinaBankGateway\KinaBankGateway;

/** @var KinaBankGateway $kinaBankGateway */
$kinaBankGateway
    ->requestReversal($orderId = 1, $amount = 1, $rrn = 'xxx', $intRef = 'yyy', $currency = null)
;
```
