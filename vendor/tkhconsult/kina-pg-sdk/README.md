[![Version](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/tkhconsult/kina-pg-sdk.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/tkhconsult/kina-pg-sdk)

---

> Packagist package (library) to give any php-based website an access to the interface of KinaBank that merchant systems use to process credit card based e- commerce transactions using the standard CGI/WWW forms posting method. This interface transparently supports various cardholder authentication protocols such as 3-D Secure and Secure Code as well as legacy unauthenticated SSL commerce transactions.

#### üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/TkhConsult/kina-pg-sdk)

## Install

```sh
composer require tkhconsult/kina-pg-sdk
```

### Requirements

* PHP >= 5.5
* OpenSSL >=0.9.8 

## Usage

### Step 1. Environment configuration (not required)

You can use one of the composer packages
```bash
composer require vlucas/phpdotenv
```

or

```bash
composer require symfony/dotenv
```

.env file

```dosini
# Merchant ID / Card acceptor ID assigned by bank
KINA_BANK_MERCHANT_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Merchant Terminal ID assigned by bank 
KINA_BANK_MERCHANT_TERMINAL=xxxxxxxx

# Merchant primary web site URL
KINA_BANK_MERCHANT_URL='http://example.com'

# Merchant name (recognizable by cardholder)
KINA_BANK_MERCHANT_NAME='Merchant company name'

# Merchant company registered office address
KINA_BANK_MERCHANT_ADDRESS='Merchant address'

# File name of merchant secret key
KINA_BANK_MERCHANT_SECRET_KEY=secret.key

# Payment page type (embedded / hosted)
KINA_BANK_PAYMENT_PAGE_TYPE=embedded

# Default Merchant shop timezone
# Used to calculate the timezone offset sent to KinaBank
# Refer: https://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php
KINA_BANK_MERCHANT_TIMEZONE_NAME='Pacific/Port_Moresby'

# Merchant shop 2-character country code. 
# Must be provided if merchant system is located 
# in a country other than the gateway server's country. 
KINA_BANK_MERCHANT_COUNTRY_CODE=PG

# Default currency for all operations: 3-character currency code 
KINA_BANK_MERCHANT_DEFAULT_CURRENCY=PGK

# Default forms language
# By default are available forms in en
# If need forms in another languages please contact gateway
# administrator
KINA_BANK_MERCHANT_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE=en
```

### Step 2. Init Gateway client

#### Init Gateway client through configureFromEnv method

```php
<?php

use TkhConsult\KinaBankGateway\KinaBankGateway;

$kinaBankGateway = new KinaBankGateway();

$secretKeyDir = '/path/to/keys';
$kinaBankGateway
    ->configureFromEnv($secretKeyDir)
;
```

#### Init Gateway client manually

You can reproduce implementation of the configureFromEnv() method


### Step 3. Request payment authorization - redirects to the banks page

```php
<?php

use TkhConsult\KinaBankGateway\KinaBankGateway;
$backRefUrl = getenv('KINA_BANK_MERCHANT_URL').'/after-payment/';

/** @var KinaBankGateway $kinaBankGateway */
$kinaBankGateway
    ->requestAuthorization($orderId = 1, $amount = 1, $backRefUrl, $currency = "PGK", $description = "iPhone X Pro", $clientEmail = "customer@yopmail.com", $language = 'en')
;
```

### Step 4. Receive bank responses - all bank responses are asynchronous server to server and are handled by same URI

```php
<?php

use TkhConsult\KinaBankGateway\KinaBankGateway;
use TkhConsult\KinaBankGateway\KinaBank\Exception;
use TkhConsult\KinaBankGateway\KinaBank\Response;

/** @var KinaBankGateway $kinaBankGateway */
$bankResponse = $kinaBankGateway->getResponseObject($_POST);

if (!$bankResponse->isValid()) {
    throw new Exception('Invalid bank Auth response');
}

switch ($bankResponse::TRX_TYPE) {
    case KinaBankGateway::TRX_TYPE_AUTHORIZATION:
        $orderId        = KinaBankGateway::deNormalizeOrderId($bankResponse->{Response::ORDER});
        $amount         = $bankResponse->{Response::AMOUNT};
        $bankOrderCode  = $bankResponse->{Response::ORDER};
        $rrn            = $bankResponse->{Response::RRN};
        $intRef         = $bankResponse->{Response::INT_REF};

        #
        # You must save $rrn and $intRef from the response here for reversal requests
        #
        echo '<pre>';
        print_r([$bankResponse, $orderId]);

        # Funds locked on bank side - transfer the product/service to the customer and request completion
        $kinaBankGateway->requestCompletion($orderId, $amount, $rrn, $intRef, $currency = "PGK");
        break;

    default:
        throw new Exception('Unknown bank response transaction type');
}
```
